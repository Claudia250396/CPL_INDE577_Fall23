It is a critical step in obtaining the raw material for analysis and decision-making. **Ethical considerations** are fundamental in this process, emphasizing principles such as informed consent, privacy protection, and data security. Adhering to ethical standards is essential for building trust and ensuring fairness in the treatment of individuals whose data is being collected.\n","Furthermore, **data scrubbing**, or cleaning, is an integral part of data collection, involving the correction of errors and handling missing values. This process enhances the quality and reliability of the collected data, ensuring that it is consistent and ready for effective analysis without introducing biases or inaccuracies.\n","\n","<img src= \"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5a00e7aa079aa40001b3c4fb/5d5c22e040c6beab16860e8e_data-cleaning-thumb.png\" >"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"Nc0aF-rtVb6r"},"source":["We will leverage two datasets that provide information on crime in Houston. The first dataset spans from 2009 to 2018, while the second one covers the period from 2019 to 2021. Our objective is to consolidate these datasets into a unified and cleaned dataset for comprehensive analysis. During the data cleaning process, we will focus on extracting relevant information, including the neighborhood where each crime occurred, the corresponding year, and the type of crime. Furthermore, based on the type of crime, we will categorize offenses into serious and non-serious categories. This approach ensures that our consolidated dataset is tailored to our specific analytical needs, allowing us to gain insights into crime trends in Houston over the entire period.\n","\n","This data was taken from The Kinder Institute.

sources, spanning the years 2009 to 2021, to construct a comprehensive understanding of Houston's crime landscape. The process involved adherence to stringent scrubbing procedures to ensure data accuracy and reliability. We employed strategic techniques such as handling missing values, column renaming, and selective column dropping to refine and prepare the datasets. As a result, our meticulously scrubbed and consolidated dataset, 'tabla_final,' now stands as a robust foundation for subsequent analyses, setting the stage for comprehensive insights into Houston's crime trends, geographical patterns, and offense classifications."]}],"metadata":{"colab":{"authorship_tag":"ABX9TyPyrQlOuJ5DSvCQ1UY76H+2","provenance":[]},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.11.4"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
