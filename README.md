 # INDE 577 â€” Data Science and Machine Learning

### Student: Claudia Pedroza

### Email: cp60@rice.edu

### Course Description: 
This data science course is designed to provide a comprehensive understanding of machine learning algorithms, with a focus on supervised learning, and unsupervised learning. Students will delve into the foundations of machine learning by implementing various algorithms from scratch using Python, gaining a deep insight into the inner workings of these models.

The course curriculum spans a wide range of topics and techniques, including hands-on experience with popular libraries such as Scikit-Learn, Keras, and Tensorflow. Students will not only develop a theoretical understanding of machine learning concepts but will also acquire practical skills through extensive coding exercises and real-world applications.

### Project Description: 
I built this Github repository throughout the semester. Here you will find I sub-repositories which will contain data sets, descriptive README.md files, and Jupyter notebooks illustrating implementations of the algorithms covered in this course. The covered topics include:

 **Data Science Foundations**:
  * Data Collection: Sources, Ethics, and Scrubbing
  * Data Exploration and Visualization

 **Supervised Learning**:
  * Linear Regression
  * Gradient Descent
  * Logistic Regression
  * Neural Nets
  * K-Nearest Neighbors
  * Decision/ Regression Trees

 **Unsupervised Learning**:
  * K-Means Clustering
  * Principle Component Analysis
