# Unsupervised Learning

Unsupervised learning is a machine learning paradigm where algorithms analyze datasets without labeled outputs, aiming to discover inherent patterns, relationships, or structures within the input features. Unlike supervised learning, there is no explicit guidance on the correct output, and the primary objectives include clustering similar data points, reducing dimensionality, and revealing associations among variables. Unsupervised learning techniques, such as K-Means clustering, dimensionality reduction with PCA, and association rule mining, are employed to uncover hidden insights and patterns in large and complex datasets, making it particularly valuable for tasks like customer segmentation, anomaly detection, and exploratory data analysis.
